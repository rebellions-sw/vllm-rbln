Your input helps us make **vllm-rbln** better for everyone.

When creating an issue, please provide as much detail as possible and select the appropriate label to help us triage and respond efficiently. üôè

### General Issue

These issues are used to discuss general suggestions, requests, bug reports, and other topics.

- proposal: Suggest enhancements or new functionality that would benefit the vllm-rbln.
- request: Request a specific development task that you think should be implemented.
- bug: Help us identify and fix issues by reporting bugs with clear reproduction steps.
- question: Ask general questions about using the project, understanding behavior, or seeking clarification. Ideal for newcomers or anyone unsure about how something works.
- discussion: Start open-ended conversations about design decisions, optimization features, etc. Useful for gathering community feedback before moving to a proposal.
- help wanted: Highlight tasks where contributor support is requested. Often used in combination with other labels like bug or question.

### Development-related Issue

These issue types represent development tasks that are typically addressed through pull requests.

- feature: Develop a new capability or functionality in the codebase. Should be scoped and accompanied by acceptance criteria or use cases if possible.
- model: Issues related to adding, modifying, or improving support for specific ML models. Include model details (e.g., architecture).
- core: Changes that impact core engine components such as worker, model runner, scheduler, memory management, or plugin infrastructure. These usually require in-depth review and testing.
- bug-fix: Tracks the resolution of known bugs.
- perf: Implement improvements focused on performance, such as latency reduction, memory usage, or throughput. Include benchmarks or measurement methodology if available.
- refactor: Improve readability, maintainability, or consistency without altering external behavior. Includes renaming, code modularization, or dependency cleanup.
- docs: Improve or add to documentation. Includes README, usage guides, code comments, and tutorial examples. Helpful for improving project onboarding and understanding.
- other: Any development-related task that doesn't fit the above categories. Use this label sparingly, and consider proposing a new label if recurring themes emerge.

Please choose labels appropriately when opening an issue.
