Run mypy on changed files.

This script is designed to be used as a pre-commit hook. It runs mypy
on files that have been changed. It groups files into different mypy calls
based on their directory to avoid import following issues.

Usage:
    python tools/pre_commit/mypy.py <ci> <python_version> <changed_files...>

Args:
    ci: "1" if running in CI, "0" otherwise. In CI, follow_imports is set to
        "silent" for the main group of files.
    python_version: Python version to use (e.g., "3.10") or "local" to use
        the local Python version.
    changed_files: List of changed files to check.

# After fixing errors resulting from changing follow_imports
# from "skip" to "silent", move the following directories to FILES
