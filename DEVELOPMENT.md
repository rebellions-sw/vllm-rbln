# 🛠️ Development setup (uv)

Requirements:
- Linux x86_64 with access to the internal network (Nexus)
- Python **3.12** for this dev workflow (every CI lane syncs on 3.12; the package itself targets 3.10-3.14)
- uv **>= 0.11.25** (`uv self update`) — enforced via `required-version` in `pyproject.toml`. Older uv writes `uv.lock` in a different serialization (repeats the `tool.uv.environments` marker on every dependency), so re-locking with it produces a ~900-line noise diff.

The Nexus index requires your **LDAP account** credentials (set once, e.g. in your shell profile):

```bash
export UV_INDEX_RBLN_NEXUS_NIGHTLY_USERNAME=<ldap-username>
export UV_INDEX_RBLN_NEXUS_NIGHTLY_PASSWORD=<ldap-password>
```

> `rbln-release` (pypi.rbln.ai) uses a separate account system; credentials for it are only needed if the lock ever resolves packages from that index.

Then install the locked, team-identical environment with a single command:

```bash
uv sync --extra runtime
```

> `rebel-compiler` is separated into the `runtime` extra — it is required for NPU execution but excluded from the base dependency set. `--extra runtime` installs it alongside the rest of the locked environment.

## pyproject.toml vs uv.lock — what to edit when

| File | Role | Edit by hand? |
|---|---|---|
| `pyproject.toml` | Declares dependency **ranges** (what we're compatible with). Ships in the wheel as `Requires-Dist`. | Yes |
| `uv.lock` | Pins the **exact** versions + hashes of the full graph (what dev/CI actually installs). Never shipped. | **No** — only via `uv` commands |

Common tasks:

```bash
# Add / remove / change a dependency range:
#   edit pyproject.toml, then refresh the lock and commit BOTH files
uv lock

# Bump one package to the latest version allowed by pyproject (lock-only change):
uv lock --upgrade-package rebel-compiler

# Reproduce the CI-identical environment (never resolves, only installs the lock):
uv sync --extra runtime
```

Rules of thumb:
- If you edited `pyproject.toml`, always run `uv lock` and commit `uv.lock` in the same PR — pre-commit rejects drift between the two.
- CI installs with `uv sync --locked`, which fails if `uv.lock` doesn't match `pyproject.toml`.
- Never edit `uv.lock` by hand.

### Bumping a dependency

Pick the variant that matches what you are changing — all of them keep every
other package's pin untouched:

```bash
# Raise a range in pyproject.toml (e.g. optimum-rbln>=0.11.1a2 -> >=0.11.1a4):
#   edit pyproject.toml, then re-lock. Plain `uv lock` only re-resolves what the
#   edit invalidated; everything else keeps its pin.
uv lock

# Bump one package within its existing pyproject range (lock-only change):
uv lock --upgrade-package optimum-rbln
# or pin an exact version:
uv lock --upgrade-package optimum-rbln==0.11.1a4

# One-command alternative: update the range in pyproject.toml AND bump exactly
# that package in the lock in a single step:
uv add "optimum-rbln>=0.11.1a4" --upgrade-package optimum-rbln
```

The `--upgrade-package` flag scopes the upgrade to the named package only —
without it, resolution may also move other packages; with `--upgrade` (no
package argument) it re-pins the **entire** graph.

**Never run `uv lock --upgrade`** (full-graph refresh): it re-pins every package
in the lock at once. Whole-graph refreshes need a dedicated PR and team review.

### Installing a package from pypi.rebellions.in (ad-hoc, local only)

`pypi.rebellions.in` is deliberately **not** registered as an index in
`pyproject.toml`: packages appear and disappear there independently of dev/main,
so a lock refresh could pin versions that must not be used (only builds published
to nexus may be pinned — see the rebel-compiler version policy below). If you need
a package that only exists there, install it into your venv ad-hoc — this never
touches `uv.lock`:

```bash
uv pip install <package>==<version> \
  --extra-index-url "https://<ldap-username>:<ldap-password>@pypi.rebellions.in/simple/"
```

### rebel-compiler version policy

**Who updates:** whoever needs it (need-driven). The team merging a feature
that requires a newer compiler includes the bump in that PR, as a separate
commit (easy to revert), e.g. `chore(deps): bump rebel-compiler to 0.11.1.devXXX`.

**Version eligibility:**
- Only builds that **passed the compiler nightly CI** may be pinned in
  `uv.lock` or referenced in `pyproject.toml`. Builds from compiler feature
  branches are for local/CI experiments only — never commit them to the lock.
- On `main`, only **official release versions** are pinned. Dev builds
  (`*.devNNN`) are allowed on `dev` only; they are replaced with a release
  version when merging/releasing to `main`.

**Lock update vs dependency update — decide separately:**
- **`uv.lock` only** — the new build's features/bugfixes are needed, but the
  code still works with older compiler versions in the allowed range
  (e.g. `dev304` → `dev350`): `uv lock --upgrade-package rebel-compiler`.
- **`pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock` together** — the code is no longer
  compatible with older compiler versions, i.e. it depends on something that
  does not exist below a certain compiler version (e.g. a new custom op that
  only exists from `0.11.2.dev0`): raise the lower bound in `pyproject.toml`
  (`~=0.11.1.dev0` → `~=0.11.2.dev0`) and regenerate `uv.lock` in the same
  PR. Bumping only the lock leaves the declared range permitting older
  versions that no longer work — other environments can still resolve a
  broken combination.
- Version-line change (`0.11.x` → `0.12.x`) is a release-level decision:
  always `pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock`, with API/compatibility review.

**Testing a specific build without touching the lock:** use the
`rebel_compiler_version` input of the CI workflow — it installs that version
as an override and leaves `uv.lock` unchanged.

To bump `rebel-compiler` to the latest nightly (do not edit `pyproject.toml`):

```bash
uv lock --upgrade-package rebel-compiler
# or pin a specific version:
uv lock --upgrade-package rebel-compiler==0.11.1.dev200
# commit the updated uv.lock
```

Available versions can be checked by browsing the index directly
(e.g. <https://nexus.mgmt.rbln.in/repository/pypi-group-nightly/simple/rebel-compiler/>,
LDAP login required), or:

```bash
curl -s -u "$UV_INDEX_RBLN_NEXUS_NIGHTLY_USERNAME:$UV_INDEX_RBLN_NEXUS_NIGHTLY_PASSWORD" \
  https://nexus.mgmt.rbln.in/repository/pypi-group-nightly/simple/rebel-compiler/ \
  | grep -oE 'rebel_compiler-[0-9][A-Za-z0-9.+]*' | sort -uV | tail -10
```

## External contributors (no Rebellions internal network)

`uv.lock` pins packages to Rebellions-internal indexes, so `uv sync` only works
inside the internal network. Internal nightly builds of `rebel-compiler` are
not published externally. External contributors instead:

1. Request an **external LDAP account** via the
   [Request RBLN SDK/Portal Access](https://rebellions.ai/request-form-rbln-sdk/).
2. Install `rebel-compiler` with that account, following the
   [official guide](https://docs.rbln.ai/latest/getting_started/installation_guide.html).
3. Install `vllm-rbln` on top — everything else resolves from public indexes:

```bash
# 1. Create a venv and install rebel-compiler with your external LDAP account
#    (per the official guide above):
uv venv --python 3.12
source .venv/bin/activate
# ... install rebel-compiler into this venv per the official instructions ...

# 2. Install vllm-rbln (rebel-compiler is an optional 'runtime' extra,
#    so your separately installed copy is left untouched):
uv pip install -e ".[test]"
```

`rebel-compiler` is an optional `runtime` extra and is not pulled in by the
base `test` install, so the resolver never conflicts with your separately
installed copy. Everything else resolves from public indexes (PyPI,
`wheels.vllm.ai`, `download.pytorch.org`); internal indexes are skipped
automatically.
