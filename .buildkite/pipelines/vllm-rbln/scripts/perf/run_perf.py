"""Turn a target file into a `vllm bench sweep serve` run.

The sweep itself -- starting the server, waiting for it, benchmarking, resetting
caches, tearing down, resuming -- is upstream's. This adds only what a target
needs and the sweep cannot express: the chip it runs on, the env it runs under,
and the device budget it fits in.
