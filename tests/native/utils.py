    Lets a whole device-touching file share ONE spawn instead of spawning per
    test: the child is a real pytest run (so it resolves fixtures,
    parametrization and skips itself) with the spawn-child guard set, and the
    native conftest's logreport hook serializes each phase report to a file.

    The parent passes the tests it actually selected rather than the file, so
    -m/-k/--deselect mean what they say: handing over the file would run the
    deselected tests too (on the NPU, invisibly), and would re-run any unmarked
    test of a mixed file that the parent is already running in-process.
    --device-tensor / --model-compile / --num-hidden-layers are forwarded so the
    child's skip/run decisions and engine config match the parent's, and --tb /
    --maxfail so the reports it builds are rendered and cut off the way the
    parent was asked to.

    The child's raw stream is redirected to a log file rather than inherited.
    Inheriting it would put the WHOLE file's output -- every EngineCore
    traceback included -- into the parent's capture buffer for the *first* test
    of the module (the one whose pyfunc_call triggered this spawn), which pytest
    then discards when that test passes. Per-test output reaches the parent via
    each record's sections instead; the log file is the fallback for a child
    that dies without recording anything. ``stream_output`` (parent run with
    -s) inherits the stream instead, since nothing is capturing it then."""
