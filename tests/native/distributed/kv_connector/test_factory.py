# What can break here is a stale module path or class name after a rename. NIXL is
# resolved all the way to its class; LMCache only by presence, since its module
# imports `lmcache_rbln` at load time.

# Importing the factory module fires the register_connector side effects, exactly
# as register_ops() does under VLLM_RBLN_USE_VLLM_MODEL in production.
