"""Builders for the RBLN NIXL connector tests.

``conftest.py::make_worker`` runs the worker's real ``__init__`` on a real
VllmConfig and KVCacheConfig over real KV tensors, faking what it cannot reach
here: the NIXL agent and its config, the ``nixl_rbln`` adapter, ``rebel``'s
context lookup, ``get_device``, the TP-rank accessors and the view-opt env
flag. ``build_worker`` below goes further and replaces upstream's ``__init__``.

``KvGeometry`` is why that is affordable. One object produces all three views of
a geometry -- the KVCacheConfig the worker is built with, the tensors it
registers, and the sharding the adapter reports -- so a test varies one value
and the three cannot drift apart. An MLA geometry has only the last two: the
engine config here is non-MLA, so no worker can be built over an MLA cache.
Import lazily from a fixture: this module pulls in vllm.config.
