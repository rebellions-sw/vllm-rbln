    Peers pair by what they actually hold, on two axes that compose: KV heads
    (`_build_head_matched_remote`) and layers (`_layer_overlap`). Any TP or PP
    degree on either side works within these bounds. DP and EP are invisible --
    a replica is its own engine, and EP does not shard the KV cache.

      * the two pipeline sizes must tile each other
      * both sides pipelined requires equal TP, and a pipelined peer may not
        have MORE TP ranks
      * D2D only: one of OUR chiplet areas must fit inside a single peer rank's
        band (heads per area <= total KV heads / peer TP)
      * each side's TP degree must divide the model's KV heads; below that
        upstream replicates one head across ranks, which no head band names
      * D2D only: the coarser side's heads per area must be a whole multiple of
        the finer side's, or a descriptor would carry part of a head

    Not supported
    -------------
      * D2D only: unequal TP with MLA (`_check_mla_constraints`)
      * unequal P/D block sizes with unequal TP or with PP; the equal-TP,
        non-pipelined case is upstream's and unaffected
      * sliding-window attention with any model parallelism across P/D --
        unequal TP or PP on either side
      * with PP: Mamba/SSM and cross-layer-blocks
