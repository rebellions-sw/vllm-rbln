"""Which padded batch a step runs, agreed across the data-parallel ranks.

RBLN compiles fixed decode shapes, so every step must land on a compiled
``(num_reqs_padded, query_len)`` pair. The ranks need not land on the *same*
pair: a rank whose peers drafted while it did not runs its own query length and
nothing hangs. Two things have to hold instead, and the module mirrors upstream's
``vllm/v1/worker/dp_utils.py`` in shape:

- ``num_tokens_padded`` is the same on every rank, because that is what the
  fused-MoE all-gather sizes off.
- each rank's ``num_reqs_padded * query_len`` fits inside it. A caller can break
  this one by running a pass at a length the ranks never settled on, so the rules
  state it where they return.

``(num_reqs, query_len)`` are the free variables; tokens are their product. The
result therefore always states ``query_len`` outright: callers stage from it and
never divide ``num_tokens_padded`` to recover it.
