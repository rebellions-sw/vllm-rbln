# --- Step phase: prefill graph or decode graph -------------------------------
#
# RBLN compiles a graph per shape, so a step runs one graph or the other, never a
# mix. Two functions answer which, because the scheduler decides the phase but
# every PP rank has to arrive at the same answer:
#
#   is_prefill(request)         2 or more tokens left to compute. The definition,
#                               on pre-advance state only the scheduler holds.
#   step_is_prefill(sched_out)  2 or more non-draft tokens scheduled. The same
#                               phase, from what every rank receives alike.
#
# They can disagree only on a prefill scheduled exactly 1 token. That does not
# happen: with 1 token left, is_prefill() already reports decode, which is where
# a 1-token prompt, a chunked prefill's last token, a full remote-KV match and a
# full prefix-cache match all land -- and no clamp in schedule() cuts a chunk
# that short. The scheduler tests pin both views together across whole runs.
#
# If that ever breaks, an unfinished prompt runs on the decode graph, and
# is_intermediate_chunked_prefill falls with it since it ANDs the phase: the step
# gets sampled and drafts get proposed with no anchor token, landing drafts on a
# request that is still prefilling.
