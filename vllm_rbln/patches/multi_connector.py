"""Backport of vllm-project/vllm#46865 (``2285cfc``).

``MultiConnector`` handed empty blocks to every sub-connector that did not win
the lookup. An offload connector records those block ids for its store path, so
blank blocks mean "cannot store". On a prefill instance with a cold cache nobody
wins, so no child ever sees the real blocks and the cache never bootstraps.

TODO(vllm>=0.26.0): delete this module, its entry in ``patches/__init__.py`` and
``tests/native/patches/test_multi_connector.py``.
