"""Wall-clock metrics for the native runner, installed only under VLLM_RBLN_METRICS.

Three ranges are timed with perf_counter: the pass (execute_model through
sample_tokens), the model call, and the sampler call with the bookkeeping over its
output. The last two are reported as one sum, so MODEL + SAMPLE carries the same call
count as E2E and the difference of the two means is the host overhead around the
graphs. The bookkeeping is in that sum because it holds the step's first blocking read
of the sampler output -- the cast that used to hold it inside _sample is gone, and
leaving the read untimed drops this section to dispatch cost while the E2E residual
absorbs the wait. Async defers that read out of the pass, so there it is dispatch.
A pass is recorded only once its phase and its graph time are both known, which is
what keeps those counts equal.

Spec decode moves that first blocking read again -- into the spec-only logits gather
in execute_model's postprocess block, which syncs on the target forward. The gather
is an inline block with no method to wrap, so timed_region folds the runner's
"postprocess" profiler region into the graph sum; it is empty without spec decode.
The drafter, which runs between _sample and _bookkeeping_sync, is deliberately not
folded: MODEL + SAMPLE stays the main-graph number, and the drafter's time -- under
EAGLE/MTP a draft-model forward, plus any sampler wait its first read absorbs --
shows up in the E2E residual.

The whole feature lives in this module so the runner carries no metrics code at all. A
range that is not a whole method -- the model call sits mid-way through execute_model --
is reached by wrapping the callable the runner holds, and the phase, which is a local of
execute_model, is read where the runner computes it.
