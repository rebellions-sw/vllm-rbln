# NOTE(eunji.lee): Keep this module free of top-level imports.
# vLLM resolves platform plugins lazily on the first
# `vllm.platforms.current_platform` access, which almost any
# vLLM import triggers. If importing `vllm_rbln` pulls in vLLM before `register`
# is bound, the plugin loader re-enters this partially initialized module,
# `getattr(module, "register")` raises, and vLLM falls back to CpuPlatform.
