    guards.

    A clone rather than the target with its `__code__` swapped, because a swap
    is visible to every other holder of the target for as long as it is
    installed. One clone per key keeps the fast path free of shared mutable
    state, and lets a bound method be dispatched without touching the code
    object its whole class shares.

    The table is a cache, not an allow-list: an unseen key is compiled on the
    spot rather than rejected. Key completeness is a precondition this class
    does not check -- once a key is registered its graph is served forever, so
    a key coarser than Dynamo's guards is wrong rather than reported. What
    keeps it honest is `_value_key` refusing an argument it cannot key.
