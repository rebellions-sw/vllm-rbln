# What is the difference between the official original version and one
# that has been converted into a sequence classification model?
# Qwen3-Reranker is a language model that doing reranker by using the
# logits of "no" and "yes" tokens.
# It needs to computing 151669 tokens logits, making this method extremely
# inefficient, not to mention incompatible with the vllm score API.
# A method for converting the original model into a sequence classification
# model was proposed. See：https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-Reranker-0.6B/discussions/3
# Models converted offline using this method can not only be more efficient
# and support the vllm score API, but also make the init parameters more
# concise, for example.
# llm = LLM(model="tomaarsen/Qwen3-Reranker-0.6B-seq-cls", runner="pooling")

# If you want to load the official original version, the init parameters are
# as follows.

    # Why do we need hf_overrides for the official original version:
    # vllm converts it to Qwen3ForSequenceClassification when loaded for
    # better performance.
    # - Firstly, we need using
    #   `"architectures": ["Qwen3ForSequenceClassification"],`
    #   to manually route to Qwen3ForSequenceClassification.
    # - Then, we will extract the vector corresponding to classifier_from_token
    #   from lm_head using `"classifier_from_token": ["no", "yes"]`.
    # - Third, we will convert these two vectors into one vector.
    #   The use of conversion logic is controlled by
    #   `using "is_original_qwen3_reranker": True`.

    # and document for better reranker results.
